# Phylogenetic Effects
Will work very similar to breeding values (in fact I think it work work if you put in a phylogeny in pedigree format). Might want to include different modes of evolution.

Additionally we could have an argument to specify a covariance matrix which can be used to generate the effects. This means that as well as relationship matrices for phylogenies and pedigrees, we could also incorporate spatial effects.
