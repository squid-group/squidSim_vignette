# The {squidSim} R package {.unnumbered #intro}

The {squidSim} R package is designed to simplify data simulation from a highly flexible set of models, including:

- Correlated and interacting predictor variables
- Non-Gaussian response variables (Poisson and binomial)
- Crossed and nested hierarchical structures
- Random intercepts and slopes
- Univariate and multivariate data
- Within level-specific residual variance (DHGLMs)
- Additive genetic effects (animal models)
- Phylogenetic effects with different models of evolution
- Temporal and spatial autocorrelation
- Missing data (MNAR, MAR and MCAR)
- Temporal sampling

The main idea is that anything you can model using a linear mixed effect model framework (assuming underlying multivariate normality) you can simulate using the {squidSim} package.

<!-- ### SQuID ethos {-}

Create population and then sample from it

### Why use {squidSim}? {-}
For people confident with programming in R, simulating data doesn't provide a huge challenge. However, to those less confident with programming, or the process of data simulation more generally, starting with simulations can seem like a daunting task. The {squidSim} R package is designed to facilitate that transition, and to focus attention on the data structure and parameters needed for simulation, rather than the programming knowledge.

{squidSim} also provides a useful tool for experienced programmers. One problematic aspect of collaborative coding (or reviewing someone else's code) is that many people have very contrasting programming styles. Another motivation for the {squidSim} package is that it provides a consistent framework for simulations, which can be interpreted by many people rather than having to decipher someone's personal code. 


### Using the vignette {-}
If you are new to using the {squidSim} package, we recommend that you read Sections \@ref(linearmod) and \@ref(hierarchical) to familiarise yourself with the {squidSim} package before moving onto the more advanced topics. The later sections assume an certain level of understanding of how the functions work. 

The vignette assumes that you have a working knowledge of R, in particular being comfortable using vectors, matrices and lists.

### Installation {-}

The {squidSim} package is currently only available on github:
```r
devtools::install_github("squidgroup/squidSim")
library(squidSim)
```

### Issues and bugs {-}
It would be great if you could report any suggestions, issues or bugs; [here](https://github.com/squidgroup/squidSim/issues) for issues relating to the package, and [here](https://github.com/squidgroup/squidSim_vignette/issues)for issues relating to this vignette. It is worth checking to see if anyone else has a similar problem first, and adding comments to their issue, before starting a new one.
