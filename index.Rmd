# What is does the squid R package do? {#intro}

The squid R package is designed to simplify data simulation, for a highly flexible set of models, including:

- Correlated and interacting predictor variables
- Non-gaussian data (Poisson and binomial)
- Crossed and nested hierarchical structures
- Random intercepts and slopes
- Univariate and multivariate data
- Within level-specific residual variance (DHGLMs)
- Additive genetic effects (animal models)
- Phylogenetic effects with different models of evolution
- Temporal and spatial autocorrelation
- Missing data (MNAR, MAR and MCAR)
- Temporal sampling

The main idea is that anything you can model using a linear mixed effect model framework (assuming underlying multivariate normality) you should be able to simulate using the squid package.

### Installation

The new squid functions are currently in the development version of the squid package on github:
```r
devtools::install_github("squid-group/squid", ref="development")
library(squid)
```

### Issues and bugs
It would be great if you could report any suggestions, issues or bugs using github issues https://github.com/squid-group/squid/issues. It is worth checking to see if anyone else has a similar problem first, and  adding comments to their issue, before starting a new one. 



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())

options(width = 300)

library(lme4)
library(MCMCglmm)
library(scales)
 devtools::load_all("~/github/squid/R")
# devtools::check("~/github/squid/R")


# devtools::install_github("squid-group/squid", ref="development")
# library(squid)

library(knitr)
# the default source hook
hook_source <- knit_hooks$get('source')
knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
  if (!is.null(n <- options$out.lines)) {
    n <- as.numeric(n)
    x <- unlist(stringr::str_split(x, "\n"))
    nx <- length(x) 
    x <- x[pmin(n,nx)]
    if(min(n) > 1)  
      x <- c(paste("[...]"), x)
    if(max(n) < nx) 
      x <- c(x, paste("[...]"))
    x <- paste(c(x, "\n"), collapse = "\n")
  }
  hook_source(x, options)
    })
