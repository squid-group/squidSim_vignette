[["index.html", "The {squidSim} R Package Vignette The {squidSim} R package", " The {squidSim} R Package Vignette Joel Pick 2024-02-28 The {squidSim} R package The {squidSim} R package is designed to simplify data simulation from a highly flexible set of models, including: Correlated and interacting predictor variables Non-Gaussian response variables (Poisson and binomial) Crossed and nested hierarchical structures Random intercepts and slopes Univariate and multivariate data Within level-specific residual variance (DHGLMs) Additive genetic effects (animal models) Phylogenetic effects with different models of evolution Temporal and spatial autocorrelation Missing data (MNAR, MAR and MCAR) Temporal sampling The main idea is that anything you can model using a linear mixed effect model framework (assuming underlying multivariate normality) you can simulate using the {squidSim} package. Why use {squidSim}? Starting with simulations can seem like a daunting task. The {squidSim} R package is designed to facilitate that transition, and to focus attention on the data structure and parameters needed for simulation, rather than programming knowledge. {squidSim} also provides a useful tool for experienced programmers. One problematic aspect of collaborative coding (or reviewing someone else’s code) is that many people have very contrasting programming styles. A major motivation for the {squidSim} package is that it provides a consistent framework for simulations, which can be interpreted by many people rather than having to decipher someone’s personal code. Using the vignette If you are new to using the {squidSim} package, we recommend that you read Sections 1 and 2 to familiarise yourself with the {squidSim} package before moving onto the more advanced topics. The later sections assume an certain level of understanding of how the functions work. The vignette assumes that you have a working knowledge of R, in particular being comfortable using vectors, matrices and lists. Installation The {squidSim} package is currently only available on github: devtools::install_github(&quot;squidgroup/squidSim&quot;) library(squidSim) Issues and bugs It would be great if you could report any suggestions, issues or bugs; here for issues relating to the package, and here for issues relating to this vignette. It is worth checking to see if anyone else has a similar problem first, and adding comments to their issue, before starting a new one. "]]
